  Builds the distance, minimizer and zipcode indexes a graph needs before
  `vg giraffe` can map to it.

  scripts/prepare_pangenome_indexes.sh cannot be used for a sampled graph: it
  also derives a ref_paths list from full-length reference paths, and a sampled
  graph keeps its reference as subranges, so it stops with "only N full-length
  paths". ref_paths is unaffected by sampling anyway and is reused unchanged.
