doc: |
  Snarls for a graph, consumed only by the germline workflows' call_sv track.
  A sampled graph needs its own: the snarls shipped with the full graph describe
  sites sampling may have removed.

  Produces no output when make_snarls is false, which is how this workflow
  expresses "off" (cwlVersion v1.1 has no conditional steps).
